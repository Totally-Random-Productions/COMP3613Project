# Priority U 
## COMP 3613 - Software Engineering 2 Project 2019 
### University of the West Indies St Augustine Trinidad 

Priority U started off as an idea to refactor an existing app then grew into a web app itself. 

Over the 15 weeks of this semester our group was challenged to not only build and deploy an app but do so while adhering to SCRUM practices. 

This is the result: https://priorityu.herokuapp.com/

You can try logging using the username: `alex` and password: `password` to see the app in action. Or create your own profile.
